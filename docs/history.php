<h1>History</h1>
<p>
DoubleCommand started out as a hack of iJect, which was generously GPL'd by
Christian Starkjohann. So go check out the great software he makes over at
Objective Development <a href="http://www.obdev.at/">www.obdev.at</a>.
<br />
Called DoubleCommand because originally it was used to give the old
PowerBooks a second Command key, where there was an enter key.
