<h3>Installing DoubleCommand on Mac OS X</h3>
<p class="body">To install DoubleCommand, please perform the following steps:</p>
<p class="body">1.	Remove any older versions of DoubleCommand, iJect, uControl, CommandandControl or PowerDelete (see below for how to do that). These are conflicting software.</p>
<p class="body">2.	Open a Finder window and go to the "Library" folder directly on your Mac OS X startup volume. (There are several folders named "Library". We mean the one in the root of the startup volume, NOT in the System folder!)</p>
<p class="body">3a. If there is a folder named "StartupItems", drop the "DoubleCommand" folder into it. The DoubleCommand folder is in the "StartupItems" folder in the distributed disk image.<br />
3b. If there is no such folder, drop the whole folder "StartupItems" from the distributed disk image directly into the "Library" folder.
	You should have created a directory hierarchy like this in any case:</p>
<p class="body">	/Library/StartupItems/DoubleCommand</p>
<p class="body">4.	Restart the computer</p>
<p class="body">5.  After rebooting, a warning will pop up asking you whether you want to 'Fix and Use' or 'Use' DoubleCommand. Click 'Fix and Use'.</p>
<p class="body">After rebooting a second time, DoubleCommand will be active.</p>
<p class="body"><em>Note:</em> You need Administrator rights to install startup items, but you do not need to be the Unix super user "root". The user account which is created during installation of the operating system has administrator rights.</p>

<h3>Removing DoubleCommand</h3>
<p class="body">To remove DoubleCommand from your machine:</p>
<p class="body">1.	Delete the DoubleCommand folder in /Library/StartupItems on your Mac OS X startup volume.</p>
<p class="body">2.	Restart your computer.</p>

<h3>Removing conflicting software</h3>
<p class="body">To remove conflicting software from your machine:</p>
<p class="body">1.	Delete the iJect, uControl, CommandandControl or PowerDelete folder in /Library/StartupItems on your Mac OS X startup volume.</p>
<p class="body">2.	Restart your computer.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<p class="body">DoubleCommand has been developed for Mac OS X. It is known to run on Mac OS X 10.1.0 through to Mac OS X 10.2 and probably runs on later versions, too. However, since it links to internal kernel structures, newer versions of the kernel may break DoubleCommand. If this happens check with this web site for an update that will work with the new kernel.</p>
<p class="body">If your machine does not boot after installing DoubleCommand, hold the option (alt) key during booting and boot to Mac OS 9. You can remove DoubleCommand from Mac OS 9.</p>
