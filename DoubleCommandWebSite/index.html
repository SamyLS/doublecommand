<h2>Welcome to DoubleCommand!</h2>
<p class="body">By Michael Baltaks <a class="navigation" href="mailto:&#109;&#98;&#97;&#108;&#116;&#97;&#107;&#115;&#64;&#109;&#97;&#99;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;?subject=DoubleCommand">(email)</a></p>

<h3>About DoubleCommand</h3>
<p class="body">
DoubleCommand is software for Mac OS X (a kernel extension) that lets you remap keys, in other words change the way your keyboard works. Often used to make a PC keyboard more comfortable with a Mac, swapping the Alt (Option) and Windows (Command or Apple) keys, since they are in swapped positions on Mac and PC keyboards. DoubleCommand is a quick and easy way to fix this if you use a PC keyboard with your Mac. Called DoubleCommand because originally it was used to give the old PowerBooks a second Command key, where there was an enter key. For the full feature listing look at the <a class="navigation" href="./install.html#features">install page</a>.<br />

DoubleCommand started out as a hack of iJect, which was generously GPL'd by Christian Starkjohann. So go check out the great software he makes over at Objective Development <a class="navigation" href="http://www.obdev.at/">www.obdev.at</a>
</p>
<p class="body">As a result, DoubleCommand is released under v2 of the GPL. Please read the file <a class="navigation" href="Licence.txt">Licence.txt</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>News</h3>
<p class="body">
2005-05-02<br />
Over the weekend I have been sent many emails informing me that DoubleCommand does not work with Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger). At this stage I don't know what will be involved in updating, and so I can't give any idea of when DoubleCommand will be ready.</p>
<p class="body">
2005-04-12<br />
DoubleCommand 1.5.4 released for Mac OS X 10.3, added support for Enter as Forward Delete, and support for the new PowerBook's enter key.</p>
<p class="body">
2004-12-17<br />
DoubleCommand 1.5.3 released for Mac OS X 10.3, added support for Control + Home/End PC style and fixed a bug with Command -> Option mapping.</p>
<p class="body">
2004-08-10<br />
DoubleCommand 1.5.2 released for Mac OS X 10.3, this release enables right side modifier keys under 10.3. Wait, right side keys? Yes, under 10.3 (I'm not sure which version since, but 10.3.4 at least) DoubleCommand can tell between the different modifier keys, so some requests for different behaviour based on which side is pressed will be fulfilled in the near future.</p>
<p class="body">
2004-07-16<br />
DoubleCommand 1.5.1 released for Mac OS X 10.3, including a new Preference pane and a standard install package.</p>
<p class="body">
DoubleCommand 1.5 released for Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther). I've realised that the install script requires the development tools, so I'll be switching to a Mac OS X package format for the next release. I also have a preference pane contributed by Christian Nadolle - it will be uploaded soon and feature in the package when that arrives.
</p>
<p class="body">
<a class="navigation" href="http://www.info.apple.com/kbnum/n25711">Mac OS X 10.3.3</a> now includes a new feature under the Keyboard preference pane - choosing the function keys behaviour! This means you can have real function keys by default and require pressing the <i><font color="#ff9922">fn</font></i> key for volume and brightness etc. The DoubleCommand feature that provided this will eventually be split to allow more fine grained control over which function keys do what, now that the OS does the basics.
</p>
<p class="body">
DoubleCommand 1.5b3 released for Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther). Fixes the shift delete as forward delete feature, and adds kernel panic protection. If DoubleCommand fails to load, it will disable itself to avoid further panics.
</p>
<p class="body">
DoubleCommand 1.4.4 released for Mac OS X 10.2 only. DoubleCommand is not yet compatible with Panther (Mac OS X 10.3). I will be working on this and will update this site when a compatible version is available.
</p>
<p class="body">Visit the <a class="navigation" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/doublecommand/">sourceforge project</a> for information on the mailing lists (want email when there's a new version? Subscribe to <a class="navigation" href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/doublecommand-announce">doublecommand-announce</a>) and source code access via <a class="navigation" href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=65339">cvs</a>.</p>


<h4>Suggestions not yet included</h4>
<p class="body">For the full list of features working now see the <a class="navigation" href="./install.html#features">install page</a>.</p>
<p class="body">Current suggestions (some in progress now):</p>
<ul class="body">
<li>Giving Command-Tab back to applications (see <a class="navigation" href="http://ragingmenace.com/software/pulltab/">ragingmenace.com</a> for this).</li>
<li>Configuring F keys.</li>
<li>Using F keys for Page up and Page down.</li>
<li>Enter as Control - click (pseudo right mouse button).</li>
<li>Num lock/clear as forward delete.</li>
<li>F11 toggles Delete/Forward Delete.</li>
<li>F keys for volume control.</li>
<li>Turning the Option key into an <i><font color="#ff9922">fn</font></i> key.</li>
<li>Turning the Control key into an <i><font color="#ff9922">fn</font></i> key.</li>
<li>Smart Caps Lock (shift turns it off).</li>
<li>F1 - F4 as undo, cut, copy and paste.</li>
<li>F14 and F15 as standard F keys.</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">If you have any suggestions or comments, just <a class="navigation" href="mailto:&#109;&#98;&#97;&#108;&#116;&#97;&#107;&#115;&#64;&#109;&#97;&#99;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;?subject=DoubleCommand">email me</a>. Unfortunately, DoubleCommand can't tell which application is being used and so can't be configured per application right now.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p class="body">DoubleCommand is for Mac OS X only, if you want this feature in Classic as well, see the end of this page.</p>

<p class="body">New to the Mac? Here's a guide that might help from <a class="navigation" href="http://arstechnica.com/guides/tweaks/miniguide.ars">Ars Technica</a>. And you may wish to know what those symbols in the menus mean:<br />
<img src="command-key-symbol.gif" border="0" alt="Command Key Symbol" /> is the Command (or Apple) key located next to the space bar on both sides on most Mac keyboards.<br />
<img src="option-key-symbol.gif" border="0" alt="Option Key Symbol" /> is the Option (or Alt) key located next to the Command keys on both sides on most Mac keyboards.<br />
<img src="control-key-symbol.gif" border="0" alt="Control Key Symbol" /> is the Control key located next to the Option keys on both sides on most Mac keyboards.<br />
<img src="shift-key-symbol.gif" border="0" alt="Shift Key Symbol" /> is the Shift key located above the Control key on both sides on most Mac keyboards.<br />
</p>
<p class="body">For real Function keys under Mac OS X (10.3.3 and above have this feature already), see <a class="navigation" href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20020701082358340">macosxhints.com</a> - or just use DoubleCommand.
</p>
<p class="body">For an alternative forward delete, try <i><font color="#ff9922">fn</font></i> delete.
</p>
<p class="body">You may experience problems using a key like enter as a modifier when dragging with the trackpad if you have "ignore trackpad when typing" turned on. You can simply go to the Keyboard preference pane and turn this feature off if you have this trouble.
